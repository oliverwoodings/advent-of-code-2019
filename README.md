# advent of code 2019

These are my solutions for Advent of Code 2019 - [https://adventofcode.com/2019/](https://adventofcode.com/2019/).

Questions 1-10 were done initially just in Chrome using Snippets. Day 11 onwards was in Node.

My intcode computer was very slow until day 11, when i got rid of the stupid recursion + defer pattern and switched to a while loop.
